# Sea-Friend-Finder

Find your oceanic buddy! Within this "Friend-Finding" application npm packages and express are being implemented.

The user will start out on the home.html page and be prompted to go to the survey.html page through a button. They will take a short survey of 10 questions. Each answer is set on from 1-5, based on how much the user agrees with the question or statement. The logic behind the users answers that will display their closes match is between a sum of total numbers entered by the user and the array compaared.

After the user answers the 10 questions a modal will pop up, displaying a title and image of the sea creature they match the best with!
